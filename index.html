    <h1> <b>CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT THE <abbr title="World Wildlife Fund">WWF</abbr> HAS DONE TO MITIGATE IT</b></h1>
    <p<><ins>Exercise 1</ins></p>
    <p><abbr title="World Wildlife Fund">WWF</abbr>'s mission is to stop the <strong>degradation</strong> of our planet's natural environment.</p>
    <h2><b>What is Climate Change?</b></h2>
    <p><b>Climate change</b> is the <i>alteration of weather patterns from the norm.</i> This is <b>usually</b> due to the accumulation of greenhouse gasses like <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr> and <abbr title="Nitrogen dioxide">NO<sub>2</sub></abbr>, usually from burning, industrial effusions and other related human activities.</p>
    
    
    <h2><abbr title="World Wildlife Fund">WWF</abbr> and climate change.</h2>
    <p><abbr title="World Wildlife Fund">WWF</abbr> has actively invested their efforts into dealing with climate change, because <em>how would wildlife survive in an environment whose climate disfavours that purpose.</em></abbr></p<>
    <q<>They've done this by <mark>sensitizing masses on cleaner waste disposal techniques and the importance of adopting safer fuel management practices.</mark></p>
    <p>Here's a quote from <abbr title="World Wildlife Fund">WWF</abbr>'s website: </p>
    <blockquote><cite>https://www.worldwildlife.org/about</cite> For more than 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive.

As the worldâ€™s leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. <del>At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.</del></blockquote>
